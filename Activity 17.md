### Create a social security number module
##### Create a social security number class:
```python
class SS:
    class InvalidSocial(ValueError):
        pass
    def __init(self):
        self.social = self.getss
    
    def validatess(self):
        check that self.ss is valid
        Anywhere that you find the ss is invalid raise self.InvalidSocial
    
    def getsocial(self):
        self.ss = input("Social: ")
        try
            self.validatess()
        except InvalidSocial:
            print("Invalid SS, please try again\n")
            self.getsocial()        
        
        
```
- validate should check that a valid ss number has been put in. If not it should raise the InvalidSocial exception. Since InvaldSocial is inside the class you will have to call it with self.InvalidSocial.

#### Create the module
- put the code for this module in a file ss.py

### Create an employee module
#### Create an employee class
1. Your first line of code should be 
    ```python
       from ss import *
    ```

2. Your class should have an __init__ method with an optional parameters for the employee information. 
   ```python
    def __init__(self, last=None, first=None, start=None, pay_rate=None, social=None)
   ```
   Where social is SS class, first, last, and start are strings, and pay_rate is a float. 
   - check to see if first is None, if so then input the employee. Make sure to use the social class to get the social
     security number.
   - if first is not None, then
   ```python
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.start = start
        self.pay_rate = pay_rate
        self.social = social
    ```

3. Create a __str__ method that returns a string with all the employee information in a nicely formatted string.

#### Create the module
- put the code from this module in a file employee.py

### Create a new file employeedb.py

- Import the employee module
```python
from employee import *
```
- Instantiate the employee class:
```python
emp1 = Employee()
```
- Instantiate the employee class with
```python
emp2 = Employee('Jim', 'Bob', '10/22/14', 23.50, '045-23-3333')
```
- Print the employees
```python
print(emp1)
print('\n\n')
print(emp2)
```
